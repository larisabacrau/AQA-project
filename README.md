This is the final project I worked on during the automation testing course I have been attending. It contains the powerPoint presentation I created to present my work using Selenium, InteliJ, Java, JUnit, Gradle and Chrome. I applied a POM pattern while keeping in mind OOP principles using different test data management types like JSON files, data pages and data objects.
